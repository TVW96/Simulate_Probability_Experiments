## 4 individual python files for simulating each probability experiment task: 
**Task 1: Simulating Coin Tosses**

Generates a bar chart visualizing the results of simulation from 100 coin tosses. 

```python3 coin_toss.py```
##
**Task 2: Rolling a Die**

Generates a bar chart visualizing the results of simulation from rolling a 6 sided die 60 times. 

```python3 rolling_dice.py```
##
**Task 3: Drawing Cards**

Generates a bar chart visualizing the results of red and black cards from simulation of drawing 20 cards from a deck of 52. 

```python3 drawing_cards.py```
##
**Task 4: Probability of Compound Events**

Generates a bar chart visualizing the results of 1 heads, and both heads from simulation of tossing 2 coins 50 times.

```python3 compound_events.py```
##
# User Interface
In order to view the user interface of this application you have to first run each python file in order to save a copy of the simulations bar chart as an image. And then load the path of the index.html file with a prefered browser.

### Additionally there is a python file and script for executing all 4 simulations sequntially with one line of code:
run_all_simulation.py
```python3 run_all_simulations.py```
